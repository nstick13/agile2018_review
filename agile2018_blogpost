In August, Agile2018 was held at in San Diego, with 2,347 attendees attending 279 sessions, selected from 1500 applications. My learning objectives focused on sessions that helped with improving team culture and cohesion, and transformation at the enterprise level.  Below are seven key take-aways:
1. The importance of questions
  A theme in the team cohesion sessions was focusing on what types of questions you ask, whether in retrospectives or in one-on-ones.  The type of question can help build trust, and determines the type of coach you are to development teams, product owners, or executives.  One session discussed the importance of <i> humble inquiry </i>. Humble inquiry maximizes curiousity, and puts the focus on learning from someone else while accessing one's own ignorance.  This also helps remove bias from the questions.
  A related idea was shared at a session on <i> clear questions </i>.  Common in the therapy world, clear questions are essentially questions without bias, and focus on accepting answers received and asking adjacent questions.  A great exercise from this session is to ask people what they're like when they're at their best.  From there, ask adjacent questions.  Here's some examples:
   - What kind of....?
   - Where are you?
   - What happens just before?
   - Then what happens?
   You may start to feel like a therapist, but there's a reason they use these questions.  They're useful at facilitating people reaching their own outcomes, a key part of any type of coaching.
